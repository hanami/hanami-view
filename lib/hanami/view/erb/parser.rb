      # ERB parser for Hanami views.
      #
      # This is a [Temple][temple] parser that prepares a Temple [s-expression][expression] (sexp)
      # for later generating as HTML via {ERB::Engine}.
      #

      #
      # The key features of this parser are:
      #
      # - Auto-escaping any non-`html_safe?` values given to `<%=` ERB expression tags, with
      #   auto-escaping disabled when using `<%==` tags.
      # - Implicitly capturing and correctly outputting block content without the need for special
      #   helpers. This allows helpers like `<%= form_for(:post) do %>` to be used, with the
      #   `form_for` helper itself doing nothing more special than a `yield`.
      #
      # To support implicit block capture, this parser differs somewhat from Temple's example ERB
      # parser, as well as most other Temple parsers. Typical parsers prepare a single `result` sexp
      # up front, like so:
      #
      #   result = [:multi]
      #
      # As parsing occurs, new Temple sexps are then pushed onto this `result`.
      #
      # In this parser, however, we prepare a _stack_ of results:
      #
      #   results = [[:multi]]
      #
      # The first item in the stack (`[:multi]`) is the final result that will be returned at the
      # end of parsing. Every sexp that is generated during parsing will still be added to this
      # result, directly or indirectly.
      #
      # How this happens is that during parsing, every new sexp is push to the _last_ result in this
      # stack, representing the "current" result.
      #
      # The nature of stack becomes important when we encounter an ERB expression tag that opens a
      # code block, such as `<%= form_for(:post) do %>`.
      #
      # In this case, we push an `[:erb, :block, ..., [:multi]]` sexp to the last result, with its
      # `[:multi]` representing the _contents_ of that code block. We then also push this particular
      # `[:multi]` onto the `results` stack, so that any subsequent sexps are added to the block's
      # own contents.
      #
      # Then, when we encounter the `<% end %>` closing tag for that block, we pop the block's
      # `[:multi]` off the results stack. This `[:multi]` isn't lost, however, because it is still
      # referenced inside the `[:erb, :block, ..., [:multi]]` sexp.
      #
      # Taking this approach (along with the `on_erb_block` sexp-handling code in
      # `Hanami::View::ERB::Filters::Block`) allows us to implicitly capture the contents of the
      # block and output it in place. This means that helpers that expect blocks do not need to
      # explicitly call a `capture` helper (or similar) internally. Instead they can just `yield`,
      # per idiomatic Ruby.
      #
      # In fact, we pop a result off the stack _every_ time we encounter an `<% end %>` tag. To
      # acount for this, every time we encounter an ERB code tag that will have a matching closing
      # tag (such as `<% if some_cond %>` or `<% 5.times do %>`), we push another reference to the
      # _current_ last result onto the `results` stack. This allows subsequent sexps to be added to
      # the same item on the stack (they need no special handling; the special handling is for
      # blocks with ERB expression tags only) while still allowing it to be popped again when the
      # matching `<% end %>` is encountered.
      #
      # In this way, this stack of results will grow every time a new scope requiring an `end` is
      # opened, and then will shrink again as each `end` is encountered; think of it as matching the
      # level of LHS indentation if you were writing such code by hand. This allows each new
      # generated sexp to be pushed onto `results.last`, knowing that it will go into the right
      # place in the overall sexp tree. By the time we finish parsing, just a single result will
      # remain, which is the value returned.
